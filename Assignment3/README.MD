Assignment 3, implemented several kinds of ODEs for simply physics implementation. Which is very helpful for understanding different ODEs like Euler, improved Euler, semi-implicit.

Then, used semi-implicit way to implement another game(started code was given) with physics. Implemented "balls with forces and physics", "ending the game and clearing the objects", "time counting down", "game UI with input field for name and starting game", and also a "hall of fame(high scores) saved locally".

(Due to the starter code was used, I don't want to upload the code to git)
